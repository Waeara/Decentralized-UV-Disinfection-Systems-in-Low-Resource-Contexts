The IUVA UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Task Force collected a selection of case studies to highlight the wide range of UV disinfection systems being implemented for decentralized water treatment in low- to middle-income, humanitarian, and rural settings around the world. The case studies cover a wide range of projects in multiple scales and types, including schools, hospitals, communities, households, healthcare facilities, etc., across four continents â€“ Asia, Africa, Oceania, and North America. Moreover, it demonstrates the utilization of a variety of UV-based systems with different specifications of flow rates and energy sources, addressing different water sources and social environments including manually collected and streamed water from wells, groundwater, rainwater, rivers, storage tanks, and more. Focusing on the background objectives and motivations, UV technology specifications, and most importantly, the outcomes and lessons learned, we share these case studies to serve as a resource for engineers, practitioners, researchers, decision makers, and to expand public knowledge and to promote and help additional projects around the world.
