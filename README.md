# IUVA-Interactive-Map

This is the map with the excel data that was shared.
As there were no coordinates for some of the places, I just took a rough representative mark for them, so if we can get a more precise location - we can change their position easily

Notice that you can click on the icon on the top-left corner (below the zoom buttons) to watch it in full screen, or just click on the link below.
