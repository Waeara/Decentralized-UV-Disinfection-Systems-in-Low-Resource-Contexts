The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The challenge                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px;overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country. Finally, no sustainable business model has been developed due to the complication that water cannot be sold from school property. These problems may all be solved by having “boots on the ground,” so to speak. Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingThree">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The UV System                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                             </p>                             <div> <table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                             </div>                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingFour">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 Recommendations                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The challenge                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px;overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country. Finally, no sustainable business model has been developed due to the complication that water cannot be sold from school property. These problems may all be solved by having “boots on the ground,” so to speak. Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingThree">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The UV System                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively.

These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The challenge                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px;overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country. Finally, no sustainable business model has been developed due to the complication that water cannot be sold from school property. These problems may all be solved by having “boots on the ground,” so to speak. Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingThree">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The UV System                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                             </p>                             <div> <table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                             </div>                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingFour">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 Recommendations                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance. The systems require regular operation and water quality testing to ensure each component is working properly. This can be achieved with the support of a full-time operator who oversees the four locations and communicate with the Purdue team. Before this project can be implemented in other regions of the DR, the project must gain community investment in the importance of potable water and commitment to operating the system on a daily basis.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>             <center>                 <img src="Interactive map gif.gif"  width="400" style="border-radius: 50px;"/>             </center>              </html>             </div>`)[0];

Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingThree">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 The UV System                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                             </p>                             <div> <table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                             </div>                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                              <div class="card">                     <div class="card-header" id="headingFour">                         <h2 class="mb-0">                             <center>                             <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour"                              style="width:200px; font-family:Calibri; font-size: 20px; background-color:cornflowerblue; border-color:cornflowerblue; color:white; border-radius: 10px;">                                 <i class="fa fa-tint"></i>                                 Recommendations                             </button>                             </center>                         </h2>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="card-body" align="justify" style="height:200px; width:400px; overflow:auto; font-family:Calibri;                         font-size: 14px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">                             While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance. The systems require regular operation and water quality testing to ensure each component is working properly. This can be achieved with the support of a full-time operator who oversees the four locations and communicate with the Purdue team. Before this project can be implemented in other regions of the DR, the project must gain community investment in the importance of potable water and commitment to operating the system on a daily basis.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>             <center>                 <img src="Interactive map gif.gif"  width="400" style="border-radius: 50px;"/>             </center>              </html>             </div>`)[0];

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively.

These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                 <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo">                         <h4 class="panel-title">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1).

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                 <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo">                         <h4 class="panel-title">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1).

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively.

Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                 <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingFour" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> Recommendations <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance.

Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                 <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingThree" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The UV System <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country.

They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1).

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho.

The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team.

Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingThree" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The UV System <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively.

These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country.

They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country. Finally, no sustainable business model has been developed due to the complication that water cannot be sold from school property. These problems may all be solved by having “boots on the ground,” so to speak. Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingThree" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The UV System <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                         </p>                         <div> <table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingFour" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> Recommendations <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country. Finally, no sustainable business model has been developed due to the complication that water cannot be sold from school property. These problems may all be solved by having “boots on the ground,” so to speak. Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingThree" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The UV System <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                         <p></p>                         <div> <center><table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                         </center></div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingFour" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> Recommendations <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance.

The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                         <p></p>                         <div> <center><table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                         </center></div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingFour" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> Recommendations <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season.

The project team comprises undergraduate and graduate students primarily studying Engineering, Nursing, and Agriculture. Students work within four committees – Design, Communications, Sustainability, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Publication (MEP) – to provide community-scale potable water treatment systems, administer water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, prepare a long-term plan for the systems, and survey the local community on attitudes toward public health practices, respectively. Since its launch in 2012, the Water Supply course has implemented drinking water treatment systems in four primary schools within the La Vega region of the Dominican Republic. These schools are all located within 10 minutes of one another and often collaborate or work together. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed project goals, there are plans to implement a fifth system in the community of Desecho. While this small town lies on a beautiful mountainside, its increased elevation has made it difficult for them to acquire basic resources, particularly during the rainy season. They are the community in greatest need of potable water and may be provided with both a well and a treatment system for harvested rainwater to satisfy their daily water requirements.                             </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The challenge <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         Treating the rainwater to a potable quality was the easiest of the encountered challenges (Table 1). The greatest barrier to project success perhaps lies within the choice of installing these systems in elementary schools. Although they are central to the communities both socially and geographically, the academic calendar leaves the systems unused during summer and winter breaks. This lack of operation often results in equipment failure, requiring maintenance or replacement. Operators that know how to resolve these issues often change due to school staff turnover, but new operators are not sufficiently trained after accepting the role. Parents of the schoolchildren have required certifications from Dominican labs proving the water’s potability, but these labs are difficult to find in-country. Finally, no sustainable business model has been developed due to the complication that water cannot be sold from school property. These problems may all be solved by having “boots on the ground,” so to speak. Ideally, there would be a Dominican-native employee to monitor all installed systems year-round, perform maintenance, conduct water quality testing, and communicate with Purdue.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingThree" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> The UV System <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         The current source of drinking, cooking, and cleaning water in these communities is untreated rainwater. The implemented treatment systems (Figure 1) include two forms of both filtration and disinfection to produce finished water that is safe for drinking, cleaning, and cooking at the schools. Treated water can also be routed to the handwashing station (Figure 2). A sand filter is used to remove debris and large particles followed by a 1-micron cartridge filter for removal of microscopic particles, including bacteria and other microbial pathogens. A UV disinfection system inactivates microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and serves as the primary disinfectant. Zimba, an autonomous, gravity-based chlorinator, dilutes bleach to the desired concentration and provides secondary disinfection for continuous treatment during transportation and storage. The systems deliver an average of 24 L per minute and are powered by solar panels, which were installed by local trade specialists hired by the team. Once installed, the school’s designated operator is provided in-person training by Purdue engineering students, a manual written by native Spanish speakers, and videos addressing maintenance and troubleshooting. Custom manuals are written for each system and include simple explanations of each component’s purpose, manufacturer, price, operation, and maintenance. Schools are provided with compartment bag tests for E. coli, test strips for free and total chlorine, a UVT meter, and probe that measures pH and TDS, as well as a turbidimeter that is shared among the four schools.                         <p></p>                         <div> <center><table border="1" class="dataframe table-condensed table-responsive table-success">   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Parameter</td>       <td>Raw Rainwater</td>       <td>Treated Water</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Turbidity</td>       <td>8.1</td>       <td>1.18</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</td>       <td>86.8 ppm</td>       <td>63.2 ppm</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>UV Transmittance (UVT)</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>0.92</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>E. coli Most Probable Number (MPN)</td>       <td>&gt; 100 / 100 mL</td>       <td>0 / 100 mL</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>                         </center></div>                     </div>                 </div>                                  <div class="panel panel-default" style="text-align: left !important; border-color: #ffffff!important;">                     <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingFour" style="background: #ffffff!important;">                         <h4 class="panel-title" style="color:cornflowerblue">                             <a class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour">                                 <strong><i class="fa fa-tint"></i> Recommendations <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true" style="float: right;"></span> </strong>                             </a>                         </h4>                     </div>                     <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour">                         <div class="panel-body" align="justify">                         While the engineering portion of the project was relatively easy to design and implement, it will not be successful without trust from community members and year-round use and maintenance. The systems require regular operation and water quality testing to ensure each component is working properly. This can be achieved with the support of a full-time operator who oversees the four locations and communicate with the Purdue team. Before this project can be implemented in other regions of the DR, the project must gain community investment in the importance of potable water and commitment to operating the system on a daily basis.                         </div>                     </div>                 </div>             </div>                          <center>                 <img src="Interactive map gif.gif"  width="400" style="border-radius: 50px;"/>             </center>              </html>             </div>`)[0];
